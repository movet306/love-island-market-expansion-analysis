# 🌍 Love Island Localization Strategy: Language Feasibility Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project simulates a real-world business challenge I encountered during my time at a digital media company. The task was to identify **10 promising language markets** where the *Love Island* reality format could be successfully localized on YouTube.

## 🎯 Objective  
Determine the most viable languages using a **strategic multi-criteria decision matrix**, built entirely from independently sourced data.

## 🧠 Decision Framework  
The analysis was based on 5 weighted criteria:

| Criterion                | Description                                                             | Weight |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Young Population**     | % of population aged 15–34                                              | 25%    |
| **YouTube Audience Size**| Total number of active users per country                                | 25%    |
| **Reality Trend Score**  | Google Trends data on reality show interest                             | 25%    |
| **Cultural Similarity**  | Similarity to Arabic/Farsi (language, religion, digital habits)         | 15%    |
| **Competition Score**    | Manual audit of existing Love Island-style YouTube content              | 10%    |

Normalization and scoring were applied using Min-Max scaling and similarity scoring.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods  
- **Excel**: Data sourcing, scoring model, normalization logic  
- **Public datasets**: Statista, UN demographic data, Google Trends  
- **Manual research**: Cultural and competitive landscape assessment
